My "**Lightbox**" is a Simple to use Dialog Window based on **jQuery** and **jQuery's UI**.

To use this script you will need to have
jQuery 1.4 or above and the jQuery UI Scripts and CSS Files.

You can download them at [jqueryui.com][1].

To use this script, simply add the class “.sbox” to your a href and it will pull them
link into the lightbox. If javascript is off, it will open will target blank.

Please use the title attribute on your a href so that the lightbox can select a title

You will also need to find a loading gif. There’s lot’s of places to get them at so
I’m sure you will be able to find one and figure out the css fairly easy.

You can find the original source to this lightbox at my [blog][2]
You can see a live real world demo at [Rare Species Fund][3]

0) Convert from a "ahole" function to a actual jQuery PlugIn
1) Possibily add options to allow setting of loading image, resizable, etc
